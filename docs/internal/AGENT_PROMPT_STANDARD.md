# Agent Prompt Standard

All scheduled agent prompts MUST follow this structure. No exceptions.

---

## Mandatory Sections (every agent)

### 1. Identity and Mission (2-3 sentences)
Who you are, what you do, who you report to.

### 2. Turn Budget
Every agent MUST include:
```
## TURN BUDGET: [N] TOOL CALLS MAXIMUM
- At [N-5]: Begin wrap-up.
- At [N]: STOP. Save session. Exit.
- NEVER exceed 50 tool calls in a single session.
```
Budgets: Ron=30, Meg/Brock=25, Jacqueline/Scout/Gina/Madison/John=20.

### 3. Git Operations (MANDATORY -- identical for all agents)
```
## GIT: USE safe_git.py ONLY
python scripts/safe_git.py commit -m "message" --agent "[name]" file1 file2
python scripts/safe_git.py push
Do NOT use raw git commands. Do NOT fight lock files. 1 call for commit, 1 for push, max.
```
NO raw git add, commit, or push commands. NO lock file workarounds. NO GIT_INDEX_FILE tricks.

### 4. Session Startup (read context from Lore tools)
```
## SESSION STARTUP
1. python scripts/safe_git.py status
2. python scripts/save_to_loreconvo.py --read --limit 10
   (Read ALL agents' sessions. Search agent:debbie for decisions.)
3. python scripts/query_loredocs.py --list
4. Read CLAUDE.md (repo root) for TODOs and rules
5. Read docs/DEBBIE_DASHBOARD.md for Debbie's latest decisions
6. [agent-specific reads -- e.g., Meg reads docs/internal/qa/, Ron reads docs/internal/security/]
```
NO inline Python code for LoreConvo/LoreDocs access. Use the CLI scripts.

### 5. Inputs (what this agent reads)
Explicit list of files/sources this agent depends on, with paths.

### 6. Outputs (what this agent produces)
Explicit list of output files with exact paths and naming conventions.

### 7. Dependencies (upstream and downstream agents)
```
## DEPENDENCIES
Reads from: [list of agents and their output paths]
Feeds into: [list of agents that read this agent's output]
```

### 8. Session Save (MANDATORY -- identical for all agents)
```
## SESSION SAVE
python scripts/save_to_loreconvo.py \
    --title "[Agent] session YYYY-MM-DD" \
    --surface "[surface]" \
    --summary "COMPLETED: ... | BLOCKED: ... | PENDING_GIT: ... | HANDOFFS: ..." \
    --tags '["agent:[name]"]' \
    --artifacts '["path/to/output"]'
```
NO inline Python code. Use the CLI script only.

### 9. Rules (agent-specific constraints)
What this agent can and cannot do (e.g., "does NOT modify source code").

---

## BANNED from all prompts

- **No inline Python code blocks** for LoreConvo saves, git operations, or file manipulation. Reference scripts instead.
- **No raw git commands** (git add, git commit, git push, find .git -name "*.lock")
- **No hardcoded LoreConvo DB paths** (glob patterns like `/sessions/*/mnt/...`)
- **No duplicated rules** already in CLAUDE.md (just say "Read CLAUDE.md for full rules")

  |                 reads: competitive-intel tasks (RON: tagged items)
  v
Meg (QA) ---> reads Ron's code, produces docs/internal/qa/qa_report_YYYY_MM_DD.md
  |
Brock (security) ---> reads Ron's code, produces docs/internal/security/security_report_YYYY_MM_DD.md
  |                    cross-refs with Gina (BROCK-REVIEW: / GINA-REVIEW: tags)
